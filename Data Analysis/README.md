# Fitbit Data Exploration

This repo contains a program to interact with the Fitbit API to gather personal data, including steps, floors climbed, heart rate, and sleep data.


The general outline of the notebooks in this repo is as follows:
- Additional_FitBit_Exploration.ipynb: Explores My Running Cadence Pre-Post Injury
- Exploring My Fitbit Data.ipynb: Initial Exploration of My FitBit Data (heart rate, sleep, steps)
- Pull_fitbit_data.py: Template Script to Acquire FitBit Data from FitBit's API

The goal of this project was to practice: 
* downloading data from an API
* working with new types of data formats (e.g., json)
* visualizations
* statistics in Python
