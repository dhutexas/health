Health and fitness data come from a variety of sources and in many different formats.

* `json` @Fitbit
*  `api` @Strava 

The data come in different formats and are organized in a non-standard manner, thus they must be parsed and processed into a common format for analysis. In this folder you will find methods in `R` and `python` to extract and process the data into a common format.
