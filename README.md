Health Data - What Can Fitness Device Data Tell Us About Our Health?
-----------------------

For nearly three years I've worn fitness devices tracking my steps, heart rate, and other movements. This repository contains code to gather these data from the corresponding manufacturer (Fitbit, Apple, Google), clean the data, and explore the data for insights into my personal health.


Usage
-----------------------

* Explore the `Data` folder to see the available datasets.
* Run `Billboard_Top_100_Scraper.py`.
    * This program can be used to gather the top 100 country songs from Billboard.com for any range of years.
    * Or you can find a tidy dataset of every year (2002-2020) already available as `billboard_country.rds` in the `Data` folder.
